Web API's 

1. A web API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, tools, and standards used for building and interacting
with web-based software applications.
  Layman's terms: 
  Its is like a special way for different computer programs to talk to each other over the internet or like a special telephone that computer 
  programs can use to talk to each other over the internet.
  Example: 
  Let's say you have a game on your computer that needs to get information from a website. The game can use a web API to ask the website for the 
  information it needs and get a response back.
  

2. A web API typically provides access to the functionality and data of a web application, allowing other software systems to 
consume its resources and services. This can include retrieving data from a database, updating records, or performing other 
operations.
   layman's terms: 
   An API helps one program access and use the information and services of another program that is running on the internet.
   Examlple: 
   A good example of a web API in action is the Twitter API, which allows developers to create applications that can interact with the Twitter platform. 
   Twitter's special phone to ask for functionality to do things in your app like post tweets retrieving user data, searching for tweets or look up 
   information about users.

3. They can be designed to work with a variety of programming languages and platforms, making them flexible and widely 
accessible. They are commonly used to integrate different software systems, enable cross-platform functionality, and automate 
business processes. Some popular examples of web APIs include Google Maps API, Twitter API, and the Amazon Web Services API.
   layman's terms: 
   They make it easier for the computer programs to share information, work together and are often used to make different programs 
   work together or to help businesses do things more quickly and easily.
   Example: 
   Basically the same thing again, some apps use Google Maps' special phone to show maps and directions within the app.
  
Another illustration would be how web APIs can help a business through payment processing services like Stripe. Stripe provides a web 
API that businesses can use to accept payments online. By integrating Stripe's web API into their website or app, businesses can securely process 
payments without needing to build their own payment processing system from scratch.

 Synopsis:
   In layman's terms, web APIs are like special phones that different computer programs can use to talk to each other over the internet. They allow 
   different programs to work together and share information, making it easier for developers to create new applications and for businesses to automate 
   tasks. Examples of web APIs include Twitter's API for posting tweets, Google Maps' API for showing maps, and Stripe's API for processing payments.
